# ✨ Suleman Idrees  
*"Coding is the art of solving problems that were once impossible to see."*

🌌 **Welcome**  
Hi there! I'm **Suleman Idrees**, a passionate full-stack developer who thrives on solving complex problems and creating impactful tech solutions. While I focus on building web applications with technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, and **Strapi**, I also love exploring **game development** and diving into **ancient history**—especially the stories of Muslim empires and Roman wars. 💻⚡

When I’m not coding, I’m on the football or cricket field, experimenting in the kitchen with **halal recipes**, or spending time alone to recharge as an introvert. I also enjoy watching **gameplay videos** to pick up new techniques in game development—not to game, but to learn and grow in this exciting field. 🎮🏏🍳

## 🎮 **FYP - Game Development Project**  

As part of my **Final Year Project (FYP)**, I developed an engaging **educational open-world game** tailored for children from **Nursery to 8th grade**. This project merges **gameplay** with **learning**, offering an immersive experience designed to educate and entertain.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- **📚 Educational Content**: Learn about animals, their breeds, and classification systems.
- **🏕️ Village Life Simulation**: Explore historical village settings, from ancient cave dwellings to rural farming life.
- **🌍 Open-World Adventure**: Children roam freely through dynamic environments while encountering wild animals.
- **🌙 Survival Mode**: Experience thrilling night-time animal raids and learn how ancient villagers protected themselves.

This game was developed using **Unreal Engine**, blending **storytelling**, **education**, and **interactive gameplay** into a meaningful experience for young learners.
