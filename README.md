# ✨ Suleman Idrees  
*"Coding is the art of solving problems that were once impossible to see."*

🌌 **Welcome**  
Hi there! I'm **Suleman Idrees**, a passionate full-stack developer who thrives on solving complex problems and creating impactful tech solutions. While I focus on building web applications with technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, and **Strapi**, I also love exploring **game development** and diving into **ancient history**—especially the stories of Muslim empires and Roman wars. 💻⚡

When I’m not coding, I’m on the football or cricket field, experimenting in the kitchen with **halal recipes**, or spending time alone to recharge as an introvert. I also enjoy watching **gameplay videos** to pick up new techniques in game development—not to game, but to learn and grow in this exciting field. 🎮🏏🍳

## 🎮 **FYP - Game Development Project**  
As part of my **Final Year Project (FYP)**, I developed an engaging **educational game for children** aged **Nursery to 8th grade**. This game serves as an **open-world** experience where kids can learn about **animals**, their **breeds**, and **classes**. Here's a glimpse of the game's features:

- **Educational Content**: Teach children about animals of all kinds, including their species and classifications.  
- **Village Life Simulation**: Introduce children to village life in different historical eras, including ancient times when people lived in caves.  
- **Open-World Adventure**: Children can explore environments where they encounter **dangerous animals** in the wild.  
- **Survival Mode**: Simulate night-time animal attacks to show how villagers defend themselves.  

This project was built with **Unreal Engine**, combining both **game development** and **educational storytelling** to create an immersive learning experience for children. 🎮🦁🌿
